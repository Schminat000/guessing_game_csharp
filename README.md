# Overview
I wrote a little game that demonstrates the basics of C#. It is a guessing game that is high stakes! It allows the player to make guesses between 1 and 100 in order to find the randomly generated number. The user has 5 total guesses to do this. Can you win?

The reason I wrote this software was to learn the basics of C#. It contains classes, loops, functions, variables, expressions, and conditionals. I want to learn C# because it is used in the game engine Unity. I love video games, what can I say?

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studo Code to compile all the code.

I also used the Random library for C#.

# Future Work

- Next time, I would like to add a feature that makes it so you don't have to change the source code to change difficulty level.
- I would like to figure out how to add structures and unions to the program.
- Developing this in Unity would be pretty neat. I would like to add visuals to make the game more interesting and actually high stakes.
